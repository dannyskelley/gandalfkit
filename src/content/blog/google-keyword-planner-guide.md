### Step 1: Access Google Keyword Planner

1. Sign in to Google Ads: Go to Google Ads (ads.google.com) and sign in with your Google account.
2. Access Keyword Planner: Once logged in, click on "Tools & Settings" in the top right corner, and under "Planning," select "Keyword Planner."

### Step 2: Start Your Keyword Research

3. Choose a Tool Option: In the Keyword Planner dashboard, you have two options:

* Discover new keywords: Find new keywords based on terms, phrases, or your website.
* Get search volume and forecasts: Get search volume and historical metrics for specific keywords.

   Select "Discover new keywords."

4. Enter Keywords: Enter keywords or phrases related to your web design business. For example, "web design services," "website development," "graphic design," etc.
5. Targeting Settings: Adjust location targeting and language to match your target audience. For instance, if you primarily serve clients in a specific city or region, enter that location.

### Step 3: Review Keyword Suggestions

6. View Results: Google Keyword Planner will generate a list of keyword ideas based on your input. You'll see metrics such as average monthly searches, competition level, and suggested bid.
7. Filter and Sort: Refine your keyword list using filters such as search volume, competition, and bid estimates to prioritize keywords that are most relevant and feasible for your SEO strategy.

### Step 4: Analyze Keyword Ideas

8. Expand Keywords: Click on individual keywords to get more details, such as related keywords and their metrics.
9. Save Keywords: Save relevant keywords to your plan by checking the box next to each keyword. You can then download these keywords or add them directly to your Google Ads campaigns.

### Step 5: Refine Your Strategy

10. Evaluate Competition: Pay attention to the competition level and suggested bid. Choose keywords with moderate competition and sufficient search volume.
11. Long-Tail Keywords: Consider targeting long-tail keywords (phrases with three or more words) as they often have less competition and can attract more targeted traffic.

### Step 6: Apply Keywords to Your SEO Strategy

12. Integrate Keywords: Incorporate selected keywords into your website content, meta tags (title tags, meta descriptions), headings, and throughout your blog posts or service pages.
13. Monitor Performance: Regularly monitor the performance of these keywords using Google Analytics and adjust your SEO strategy as needed based on traffic and conversion data.

By following these steps, you can effectively use Google Keyword Planner to discover relevant keywords and enhance the SEO performance of your website.

Remember, keyword research is an iterative process, so continue to refine and expand your keyword list over time based on performance metrics and changing market trends.

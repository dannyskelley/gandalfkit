### 1. Discover Your Passion and Validate Your Idea



The journey begins with identifying what truly excites you. Think about your hobbies, interests, and skills. What problems can you solve or needs can you fulfill in Detroit?

Your brand is more than just a logo; it's the essence of your business. It's how people feel about your business. Take the time to craft a compelling brand story that resonates with Detroit's diverse community. Reflect on what makes your business unique. How you can communicate that through visual elements like your logo and website design?

In today's digital age, a professional website is a must have. It's your storefront to the world, especially in a busy city like Detroit.

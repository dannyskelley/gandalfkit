Your website is your 24/7 salesperson. It is often the first interaction potential customers have with your business. Imagine if that first encounter didn't go as planned. Could it be costing you valuable customers?

###### We are diving into the top 4 mistakes that cause small business websites to lose customers.

###### Fix these 4 mistakes and get more customers today.

#### 1. Lack of Clear Communication

Ever visited a website and wondered, "What exactly do they do?" If your website lacks a clear communication you are losing potential customers. Studies show this is the single biggest thing that annoys website users. The thing that makes them leave the most is not being able to tell what your business does. Visitors must understand what you offer and why they should choose you within seconds of landing on your site.

**How to fix Lack of clear communication**

Make sure your homepage clearly states who you are, what you do, and how you can solve your customers' problems. Keep it simple, concise, and compelling! Communicate the value, result, or transformation within 5 seconds in the hero of your website.

### 2. Poor User Experience

Picture this: You visit a website, and it takes forever to load. Once it finally does, you can't find the information you need because the navigation is confusing. Frustrating, right? That is the power of poor user experience. It is a surefire way to send potential customers straight to your competitors.

"I once tried to order from a local pizza place. The checkout process was so convoluted that I abandoned my cart midway. It felt like they didn't want my business."

**How to fix poor user experience**

To improve user experience, ensure your website loads quickly, the navigation is simple and information is easy to find. Put yourself in your customers' shoes. Make their journey on your website smooth and enjoyable.

#### 3. Ignoring Mobile Responsiveness

Have you ever visited a website on your phone and had to pinch and zoom to read the text or click on a link? Having a website that's not optimized for phones is a huge missed opportunity.

"I remember trying to browse a local restaurantâ€™s menu on my phone, but the text was so tiny, I could not read it. Eventually, I gave up and went somewhere else."

**How to fix mobile responsiveness**

Ensure your website is mobile responsive. Meaning it adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. Test it on various devices to ensure all content is accessible and easy to read and navigate. Your mobile visitors will thank you.

#### 4. Lack of Clear Call to Action Buttons or Contact Info

Imagine a potential customer visits your website, likes what they see, but then isn't sure what to do next. Without clear and compelling calls to action button, you risk losing that valuable lead. Call to action buttons guide visitors toward taking specific actions, whether it's making a purchase or contacting you for more information.

"I once visited a lawn maintenance website that had great samples of their work, but no clear way to hire them. I wanted to work with them, but I didn't know how to get started."

**How to fix lack of call to action buttons**

Place prominent call to action buttons throughout your website. Guide visitors towards desired actions.

Use actionable language (e.g., "Get Started Today," "Shop Now," "Contact Us") Make sure call to action buttons stand out visually. Encourage visitors to take the next step with confidence!

**Your website is a powerful tool for attracting and converting customers. Investing time and effort into optimizing it can yield significant results.**

Audit your website. Put yourself in your customers' shoes, and make improvements where needed. By avoiding these pitfalls and creating a positive user experience, you'll be well on your way to turning more visitors into loyal customers.

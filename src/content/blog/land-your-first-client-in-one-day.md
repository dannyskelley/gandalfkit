You've probably just launched your first small business. Or you are struggling to gain traction in Detroit. Landing that elusive first client can seem like an insurmountable challenge. I'm going to share with you a strategy that could have you signing your first client in as little as 24 hours. By this time tomorrow, you could be celebrating your first business success.



### The 24-Hour Strategy: Leveraging Local Networks



**1. Tap into Your Community:**

Detroit is a city known for its tight-knit neighborhoods and strong community spirit. Leverage this to your advantage! When I started my own photography business, I reached out to friends and acquaintances. Within a day, I had my first client—a neighbor who needed headshots for her new LinkedIn profile.



**2. Utilize Social Media:**

Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are your best friends when it comes to rapid client acquisition. Create compelling posts about your business, emphasizing how you can solve potential clients’ problems or fulfill their needs. When I launched my handmade jewelry business, I posted about it on local Facebook groups and received inquiries almost immediately.



**3. Offer an Irresistible Introductory Deal:**

Everyone loves a good deal, especially when trying out a new service. Consider offering a limited-time discount or a special introductory package for your first clients. When I started my tutoring service, offering the first session free helped me get several bookings right away.



**4. Attend Local Events or Markets:**

Detroit is vibrant with events, farmers’ markets, and community gatherings. Set up a booth or table showcasing your products or services. Engage with attendees, hand out flyers or samples, and make genuine connections. Face-to-face interactions can often convert potential leads into paying clients on the spot. I remember when I first started my catering business, attending a food festival led to catering a birthday party the very next day.



**5. Partner with Complementary Businesses:**

Collaborate with other small businesses in Detroit that offer complementary services. For example, if you’re a graphic designer, partner with a local printer or a marketing agency. They can refer clients to you, and vice versa, creating a win-win situation for both parties.



### From Startup to First Client in 24 Hours



Take inspiration from a new bakery in Corktown. Using the strategies above, they secured their first catering gig for a local event within hours of opening. By leveraging theirnetwork, offering delicious samples at a nearby market, and promoting their business on social media, they demonstrated how proactive outreach can yield immediate results.



Landing your first client is not just about making a sale. It’s about building momentum and confidence. Once you’ve closed that first deal, ask for feedback. Use it to refine your offerings and approach. Keep nurturing relationships with your clients. Happy customers are your best marketing tool.



What are you waiting for? Put these tips into action today and watch as your Detroit small business takes its first steps towards success.



Starting a business for the first time can be exhilarating and challenging. Remember, every successful entrepreneur began with that first courageous step. 



1. Commit to Action: Decide today that you will take at least one concrete step towards launching your business. Whether it’s setting up your social media profiles, drafting your business plan, or reaching out to potential clients, commit to making progress every single day.
2. Use Your Network: Reach out to friends, family, and acquaintances. Let them know about your business idea and ask for their support and referrals. Networking is a powerful tool that can open doors you never imagined.
3. Embrace Online Platforms: Start small but start strong. Create a simple website or social media page to showcase your products or services. Don’t worry about perfection—just get your presence out there and refine as you go.
4. Learn and Adapt: The journey of entrepreneurship is a learning process. Be open to feedback, adapt your strategies based on what works (and what doesn’t), and constantly seek opportunities to grow and improve.
5. Celebrate Your Progress: Whether it’s landing your first client, overcoming a setback, or achieving a milestone, celebrate every small victory along the way. Building a business is hard work, and you deserve to acknowledge and appreciate your efforts.



Remember, the only way to fail is to never start. Take that leap of faith, believe in yourself and your vision, and let today mark the beginning of your entrepreneurial journey. The Detroit business community is rooting for you!

# Want Better SEO? These 3 Website Upgrades Deliver Real Results

**Reach more local customers. Show up higher on Google. And finally have a website that works as hard as you do.**

At Design Gandalf, we believe every small business deserves a website that pulls its weight, especially when it comes to getting found online. While every website we build comes SEO ready, some clients want to push even further.

That’s why we offer three simple add-ons designed to supercharge your visibility and drive more traffic straight to your business.

If you’re ready to be discovered by more people in more places, these upgrades were made for you.






## 1. Individual Service Pages

**$25 per month**

Most small business websites list all their services on a single page. The problem is that Google can’t tell which service matters most or which one to rank you for.

That’s where this upgrade comes in.

We create a dedicated page for each service you offer. That means:

* More keyword coverage  
* A cleaner navigation menu  
* Better user experience for your visitors  

Whether you offer plumbing, painting, or personal training, your site will now speak Google’s language, putting your services front and center in search results.






## 2. Local Location Pages

**$25 per month**

Do you serve more than one city? Then local SEO is your secret weapon.

With this add-on, we build individual pages for every location you operate in. Each one is optimized with:

* Geo specific keywords  
* Maps and business info  
* Customer reviews from that area  

This is one of the most effective ways to show up in nearby searches and attract more customers who are already looking for your services.








## 3. Monthly Blog Integration

**$50 per month**

Google loves fresh content. Your audience does too.

With our blog add-on, you get:

* One professionally written blog post per month  
* The ability to post unlimited content yourself  
* A site that stays fresh, relevant, and Google friendly  

These posts help answer your customers' top questions, build trust, and expand your keyword reach, making your site more valuable over time.

## Small Investment. Big Results.

Every website we build is designed to grow with your business. These add-ons are perfect for business owners who want to get ahead without hiring a full time SEO team.

They are simple, affordable, and backed by our promise: no stress, no fluff, just great design and real results.

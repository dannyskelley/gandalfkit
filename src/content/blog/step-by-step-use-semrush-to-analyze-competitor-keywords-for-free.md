### 2. Access the SEMrush Dashboard:

\- Once logged in, you’ll be directed to the SEMrush dashboard. Here’s how you can analyze competitor keywords:



### 3. Enter Your Competitor’s Website URL:

\- In the SEMrush dashboard, locate the "Domain Analytics" section and enter the URL of a competitor's website that you want to analyze. For example, if your competitor is a local web design agency in Detroit, enter their website URL.



### 4. Review Competitor Overview:

\- SEMrush will provide an overview of the competitor's website, including key metrics such as organic search traffic, number of backlinks, and top organic keywords.



### 5. Navigate to Organic Research:

\- To specifically analyze the competitor’s organic keywords, click on the "Organic Research" tab or section in the left-hand menu.



### 6. Explore Competitor’s Organic Keywords:

\- In the Organic Research section, SEMrush will display a list of organic keywords that the competitor’s website is ranking for in search engines. These keywords are sorted by their position in search results, search volume, CPC (Cost Per Click), and other metrics.



### 7. Filter and Sort Keywords:

\- Use SEMrush’s filters to refine the list of keywords based on criteria such as search volume, keyword difficulty, CPC, and more. This helps you identify relevant keywords that align with your business goals.



### 8. Analyze Keyword Metrics:

\- Click on individual keywords to view detailed metrics such as search volume trends, keyword difficulty (how hard it is to rank for that keyword), and the number of search results.



### 9. Export Data (Optional):

\- If you want to save or analyze the data further, SEMrush allows you to export the keyword data in CSV format.



### 10. Apply Insights to Your Strategy:

\- Use the insights gained from SEMrush to inform your own keyword strategy. Identify high-potential keywords that your competitors are targeting and consider how you can create content or optimize your website to compete effectively.



### 11. Monitor and Iterate:

\- Regularly monitor your competitor’s keyword strategy using SEMrush and adjust your own strategy based on changes in search trends and competitor activities.



By following these steps, you can leverage SEMrush effectively to analyze competitor keywords for free and gain valuable insights to enhance your own SEO strategy.
